# C$50 Finance

C$50 Finance is a web application that allows users to manage a virtual stock portfolio. It provides features for buying and selling stocks, getting stock quotes, and viewing transaction history. This project was initially provided as Problem Set 9 (pset9) in CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course, and it has been extended and deployed by me.
